                <h2 class="fade-in">My interest</h2>
                <p class="fade-in">I have a deep passion for electronics and artificial intelligence. 
                    Exploring the inner works of electronic devices to discover their 
                    remarkable efficiency fascinates me. Additionally, I have a keen 
                    interest in unraveling the fundamental principles underlying computers 
                    and networking systems.</p>

                <h2 class="fade-in">Background and Originality</h2>
                <p class="fade-in">I grew up in Guangdong, China. In 2012, My parents and I started on
                a journey of immigration to the beautiful state of Hawaii, a transformative 
                experience that began when I was just 10 years old.</p>
            
                <p class="fade-in">I am pleased to share that I recently achieved an important milestone
                on my path towards becoming a United States citizen. I successfully
                passed the naturalization examination, and I am scheduled to participate
                in the naturalization oath ceremony on September 27, 2023. This event
                marks the final step in my journey towards becoming a proud citizen
                of the United States of America.</p>

                <h2 id="work-experience" class="fade-in">Work Experience</h2>
                    <p class="fade-in">Over the past four years, I've also dedicated a portion of my time 
                    to tutoring and mentoring middle school students, primarily focusing on 
                    MATHCOUNTS problems and selected AMC questions.</p>

                    <p class="fade-in">One particular achievement that fills me with pride is the success of 
                    one of my students in the 2022 Hawaii State MATHCOUNTS competition, where 
                    He got third place as a seventh grader. This accomplishment not only underscored 
                    his dedication but also reflected the effectiveness of our mentoring process.</p>
                    
                    <p class="fade-in">Throughout my journey as a tutor and mentor, I've had the privilege of 
                    collaborating with esteemed educators, including Mr. Park, the Washington 
                    Middle School Math Team Coach. This experience has been profoundly enriching, 
                    equipping me with the ability to plan and execute educational strategies 
                    effectively, maintain clarity of purpose, and collaborate with individuals 
                    possessing diverse perspectives.</p>

                <h2 class="fade-in">Robotics and Electrical</h2>
                    <p class="fade-in">While I may not have formal work experience in the field, my passion for 
                    electrical and computer engineering was ignited during my high school years 
                    when I became an active member of the robotics team. Within the team, I enthusiastically 
                    joined the electrical division, where I got to engage in hands-on learning and practical 
                    application of engineering concepts.</p>
